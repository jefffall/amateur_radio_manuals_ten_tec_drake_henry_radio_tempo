            <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b>Now we all know that Drake pushes the 6JB6 a little harder
than what is shown above. A good set of 6JB6's should deliver about 120

on 15 and 75 watts on 10. </b></font></font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b>Note that 6146's do not need to be pushed to get
comperable performance. Note the close match on the inter-electrode
capacitances. My book of tube specs rate the 6146 to 60mhz while the
6JB6 is only rated to 30mhz. Note also that the 6146 has a maximum
plate dissipation almost twice that of the 6JB6. A pair of 6146's
running class AB2 with a plate voltage of 750 volts will deliver an
output of 131 watts. Using the 6146, we can expect to get a little
better power output up to 10 meters. Ten or twenty extra watts are not
going to make much difference when added to 75 watts, but there is no
reason to push the 6146's to that level. Notice that with twice the
plate dissipation, the 6146's are less likely to complain and will
probably outlast a pair of 6JB6's that are being pushed for power
output. </b></font></font></small></p>

2. There is current new production in China.<br>

6. You can expect slightly better linearity at higher power levels.<br>

the 6146's need a higher plate voltage. </b></b></font></font></small></p>

transmitter in water. We just want to remove the solvent and dirt.
Afterward, allow the transmitter to dry thoroughly. You can speed up
the process by using a hair dryer but I would still recommend leaving
it to dry overnight before applying power. Make sure there is no

              <small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS </b></b></font></font></small>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>Tetrodes and pentodes, when run in grounded cathode
operation, like here, require good screen voltage regulation for
maximum linearity. </b></b></font></font></small></p>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>The 250 volt supply in the standard Drake supply is
fairly 'stiff' with plenty of current. Even so, check the screen grid
voltage at low and high power output to make sure it stays at 250
volts. A plus or minus 5 volt variation is probably okay. Anything
more, and you can improve the linearity by adding screen grid
regulation. </b></b></font></font></small></p>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>Adding regulation is simple. We can use high voltage 10
watt zeners. There is plenty of room under the chassis to locate a
couple of zeners mounted to a thick strip of aluminum to act as heat
sink. The 2500 ohm power resistor in series with the screen supply can
be used 'as-is' to supply current limiting to the zener regulator
connection. The zeners would be connected from the screens of the tubes
to ground with proper polarity observed. A .005mfd/1KV capacitor across
the zeners will take care of zener noise. </b></b></font></font></small></p>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>The open air configuration of the cabinet and high
voltage cage allows for convection cooling of the finals. This works,
but the cooling can be improved significantly by adding a small fan to
the back of the high voltage cage. We do not need a high volume fan
here because forced air cooling is not required. All we want is air
circulation a little better than what can be expected by convection
alone. </b></b></font></font></small></p>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>A 12vdc, three inch fan, commonly found in computer
power supplies is perfect for this application. It fits perfectly onto
the back of the high voltage cage, but requires four holes drilled into
the cage for mounting. A smaller fan can also be used without the need
for additional holes. The smaller fan can be mounted through existing
holes in the cage. </b></b></font></font></small></p>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>Power for the fan can be obtained from the 12vac
filament supply. A simple half wave rectifier and 100mfd filter
capacitor will generate about 20 vdc for the fan. The voltage can be
dropped to under 12vdc at the fan by using a one watt resistor. The
value of this series resistor will depend on the current required by
the fan and on how much air you want to move. Values between 50 and 300
ohms seem to work fine. If you use a resistor that is too high in
value, the fan may not even turn. Also, the fan motor requires the plus
voltage applied to its plus lead which is normally red. A reverse
connection here will not damage the fan, but it will not work.</b></b></font></font></small></p>
              <p><small><font face="arial" size="3"><font face="arial" size="3"><b><b>At 11 vdc, these fans become whisper quiet and still
move lots of air. There is plenty of room under the chassis for the
extra components. A couple of stand-off terminal can be installed
through the main chassis ventilation holes to provide an extra
terminations for the additional parts. </b></b></font></font>
